    <h3>Buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve. </h3>
    <p>Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodle</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces </li>
        <li>â…“ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
